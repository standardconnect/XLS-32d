making payments and sharing data between platforms on the XRP Ledger.
</p>

### Introduction

While developing on the XRP Ledger, it is common to create a payment request schema for manufacturing and storing transaction objects in a database. These objects, and/or the architecture in which they are stored, are usually proprietary and not interoperable with other applications or tools. A well-thought schema would enable a broader ecosystem of applications that can exchange ledger-related data.

### Motivation

The purpose of this standard is to create a universal URI schema for links and QR codes that are commonly used in making payments today. Large inspiration is taken from the URI schema standards from Bitcoin BIP-0021 and Ethereum EIP 681.
